- [Solo Project: RShiny Dashboard Using Strava Data](https://colsco.shinyapps.io/strava_data_dashboard/)
<p>
A RShiny dashboard build using my own activity data downloaded from the 
fitness tracking website strava.com.  This is an intermittently updated, endless
work in progress that I use it to try different layouts, fonts, and various 
packages relating to RShiny.

Trying different packages in this layout led me on to more specific geospatial
coding which is detailed in the mapping project below.

- [Solo Project: Geospatial Data Handling from .gpx  and .fit Files in R](https://github.com/colsco/cc_gpx_fit#readme)
<p>
Being a keen cyclist with several years' worth of ride data (above) I thought
it would be interesting to be able to map rides from .gpx files including adding
some representation of the route elevation.

This was achieved using the plotKML and leaflet packages to plot the route
in the latitude/longitude space, then using the Leaflet.hotline javascript
plug-in for R to use colour to represent the elevation at any given point.  

A full write-up of the work can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/colsco/cc_gpx_fit#readme/"></a>

- [Group Project: RShiny Dashboard for Public Health Scotland](https://colsco.shinyapps.io/phs_rshiny_dashboard_project_group4/)
<p>
A group project completed while studying on CodeClan's Professional Data Analysis
course, using open source data from Public Health Scotland with the aim of 
investigating NHS Scotland acute care hospitals and whether or not the data 
backed up the so-called "winter crisis".

- [CodeClan Final Project: R Coding](https://github.com/colsco/CodeClan_Final_Project)
 <p>
 The final CodeClan project was designed as an exercise for each individual to
 work alone to carry out an end-to-end data project. This allowed the freedom to
 consolidate and expand upon what had been taught during the course.
 
 After analysis the findings had to be presented using slides and a written
 markdown report with appropriate documentation of data source, quality and ethics.
 
 The project was written entirely in R using RStudio, with plots generated in
 ggplot.
 
 The data for this project was donated by Deloitte and comes from the Equifax 
 Ignite Direct open source data platform.

 - [CodeClan "Dirty Data" R coding](https://github.com/colsco/dirty_data_codeclan_project_colin_scotland)
 <p>
 Another earlier CodeClan exercise, this time with the sole aim of using R to tidy some
 dirty data.
