- [RShiny Dashboard Using Strava Data](https://colsco.shinyapps.io/strava_refurb/)
<p>
A RShiny dashboard build using my own activity data downloaded from the 
fitness tracking website strava.com.  This is an intermittently updated, endless
work in progress that I use to try different layouts, fonts, and various 
packages relating to RShiny.

This was removed due to the archival of necessary packages like FitFileR and rgdal.

- [Solo Project: Geospatial Data Handling from .gpx  and .fit Files in R](https://github.com/colsco/cc_gpx_fit#readme)
<p>
Being a keen cyclist with several years' worth of ride data I thought it would 
be interesting to be able to map rides from .gpx files including adding some 
representation of the route elevation.

This was achieved using the plotKML and leaflet packages to plot the route
in the latitude/longitude space, then using the Leaflet.hotline javascript
plug-in for R to use colour to represent the elevation at any given point.

- [Group Project: RShiny Dashboard for Public Health Scotland](https://colsco.shinyapps.io/phs_rshiny_dashboard_project_group4/)
<p>
A group project completed while studying on CodeClan's Professional Data Analysis
course, using open source data from Public Health Scotland with the aim of 
investigating NHS Scotland acute care hospitals and whether or not the data 
backed up the so-called "winter crisis".

- [A Data Quality Summary Tool in RShiny](https://colsco.shinyapps.io/data_quality/)
<p>
Although R contains multiple packages and functions to assess the data quality 
of a data frame, I went through a short period of handling lots of .csv and .xlsx
files and thought it would be easier just to create an app that would give me a
quick overview of the data quality of each file before I started working on it.

This shiny app is the result.  It allows any .csv or Excel worksheet to be
uploaded and returns some key information about whatever worksheet is of interest.
It also allows rows to be skipped, for example if a worksheet contains some 
commentary on the first few rows that don't actually form part of the data.

The first iteration of this was written in 2024, but I still find myself using it
from time to time when I just need a quick look at a file's data quality 
characteristics.

- [Linear Regression Model Building in R](https://github.com/colsco/wine_regression/blob/main/README.md)
<p>
This dataset was often given as a homework exercise in CodeClan and shows two 
ways to build a multiple linear regression model on a synthetic, wine-based 
dataset.

The modelling shown here runs through both a manual build and an automated
forward build using the leaps package.

There are many ways to build an explanatory model like this so this isn't 
intended to be the absolute best regression solution, but shows in detail the 
regression model building process in R.

- [CodeClan Final Project: R Coding](https://github.com/colsco/CodeClan_Final_Project)
 <p>
 The final CodeClan project was designed as an exercise for each individual to
 work alone to carry out an end-to-end data project. This allowed the freedom to
 consolidate and expand upon what had been taught during the course.
 
 After analysis the findings had to be presented using slides and a written
 markdown report with appropriate documentation of data source, quality and ethics.
 
 The project was written entirely in R using RStudio, with plots generated in
 ggplot.
 
 The data for this project was donated by Deloitte and comes from the Equifax 
 Ignite Direct open source data platform.

 - [CodeClan "Dirty Data" R coding](https://github.com/colsco/dirty_data_codeclan_project_colin_scotland)
 <p>
 Another earlier CodeClan exercise, this time with the sole aim of using R to tidy some
 dirty data.
