<!-- - [CodeClan Final Project: R Coding](https://github.com/colsco/CodeClan_Final_Project)
 <p>
 The final CodeClan project was designed as an exercise for each individual to
 work alone to carry out an end-to-end data project. This allowed the freedom to
 consolidate and expand upon what had been taught during the course.
 
 After analysis the findings had to be presented using slides and a written
 markdown report with appropriate documentation of data source, quality and ethics.
 
 The project was written entirely in R using RStudio, with plots generated in
 ggplot.
 
 The data for this project was donated by Deloitte and comes from the Equifax 
 Ignite Direct open source data platform.
