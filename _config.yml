  I'm an enthusiastic advocate of Data Analysis with an academic background in 
  Physics and over 25 years' experience in Microelectronics Engineering and 
  Manufacturing Management.  
  
  I spent time sharing my experience with others as a part of CodeClan's data
  instructor team and latterly have been working in the data team of a public
  body.
